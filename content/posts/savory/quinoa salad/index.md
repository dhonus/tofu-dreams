Just so you know, quinoa triples in size when cooked. I could feed an army. Quinoa is healthy stuff and a salad like this is my favorite way to eat it :)

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">

Cooking time: 15 minutes

Prep time: 10 minutes

### Ingredients for 3 servings
- [ ] 200g dry quinoa
- [ ] 1/2 cucumber, diced
- [ ] 1 bell pepper, diced
- [ ] 100g cherry tomatoes, halved
- [ ] 1 pomegranate worth of seeds
- [ ] 1 can chickpeas (without the water duh)
- [ ] mixed salad leaves (about 200g)
For the dressing:
- [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] juice of 1 lime
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper

#### Optionally add
- [ ] herbs (parsley, mint, or cilantro work well)
- [ ] olives
- [ ] anything else really, I'm not your mother

### Steps
1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water. Cook covered in a pot with 600ml water for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy and the water is absorbed. Let it cool or rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. (that's what I did becuase why not)
2. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cucumber, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, pomegranate seeds, and chickpeas.
3. In a small mason jar or a covered glass, mix the olive oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Shake well to emulsify.
4. Pour the dressing over the quinoa salad and toss gently to combine.
5. Serve and enjoy! Best eaten cold, keeps for a few days.
