As my first attempt at anything resembling ramen, this recipe for a chili ramen with tempeh turned out great! Ramen is a sort of a mysterious ingredient to me. It's from a different culture and cuisine and isn't server in my country. What better reason to try it out!? Maybe one day I will get to try the real deal, but for now, this will do :) .

Features a broth, some coconut/cashew cream, and a bunch of veggies.
