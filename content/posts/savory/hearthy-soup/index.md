Today I have for you an absolutely delicous soup made from all the beautiful orange vegetables that I could get my hands on. It is perfect for a cold winter day, or a light dinner. Just hearthy enough, not to kill your energy for the rest of the day. It is a wonderful mix of sweet and savory flavors, with a hint of ginger and lemon.

If you want to make it a bit more special, you can add half an orange and a piece of the peel. This will give it a bit more of a citrusy flavor. I have tried it both ways and I like them both.
