I am always in a mood for brownies! I had to tweak a bunch of recipes to get them not to be 50% sugar, which I can't stand (how can Americans do this?). 
They are very chocolatey, the espresso is mandatory. It is a good idea to use high quality chocolate, because it is dispersed throughout the batter. You may also use chocolate chips. Additionally, you can add some nuts into the batter.
I also added a bit of coconut oil to the mix, which I think makes them smell nicer.

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients for 1 tray
- [ ] 200g All Purpose Flour
- [ ] 100g melted butter/coconut oil
- [ ] 200ml plant-based milk
- [ ] 100g sugar
- [ ] 1.5 tsp vanilla
- [ ] 100g chocolate
- [ ] 40g cocoa powder
- [ ] 1 small shot of espresso
- [ ] 7g baking powder
- [ ] pinch of salt

### Steps
1. Melt the butter/coconut oil (I used a 50/50 mix) on a double boiler with the vanilla.
2. Add your sugar and whisk. Then add the milk and continue whisking.
3. In another bowl sift your flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until combined.
5. Add the espresso and mix again. The batter should just start to stick to the mixing spoon. If your batter is runny, add a bit more flour.
6. On a cutting board chop the chocolate into small pieces and fold into the batter.
7. Pour the batter in a lined baking tray and bake at 180Â°C for about 30 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.
