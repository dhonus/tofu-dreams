Dhal is a traditional indian dish made of lentils and spices, often served with rice or bread and garnished with fresh herbs. It's super easy to make and just absolutely delicious! 

Dhal typically includes a combination of lentils, spices, 
and aromatics such as onion and garlic. Common spices include turmeric, cumin, 
and mustard seeds (my favorite). Some variations also include ginger, chilies, and tomatoes. 
It is generally served with rice or bread, and garnished with fresh 
cilantro or other herbs.

Dhal is a very flexible dish and you can add a variety of vegetables to it.
Don't be afraid to add in local vegetables that you have on hand. In this recipe I have
used some zucchini, sweet potato and a tomato.
