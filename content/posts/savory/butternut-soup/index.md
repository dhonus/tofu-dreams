The time of orange soups is nigh again. With the end of summer these finally grow in abundance again. This is a pretty simple soup, using the entire squash including the skin and roasting the chickpeas together with it.

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 7 minutes

Cooking time: 1 hour 15 minutes

### Ingredients for 2 servings
- [ ] 1 butternut squash (about 500g)
- [ ] 1 can of chickpeas (about 240g drained weight)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 1 medium red onion
- [ ] 1 tablespoon thyme
- [ ] 2 cloves of garlic
#### Optionally add
- [ ] sprinkle of pumkin seeds

### Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.
2. Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Cut the squash into chunks, leaving the skin on.
3. Drain and rinse the chickpeas.
4. Use two baking trays, one for the squash and one for the chickpeas. On the tray for the squash, spread out the chunks and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, sprikle with thyme and a pinch of salt. On the tray for the chickpeas, spread them out and drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt.
5. Roast both trays in the oven for about 1 hour, until the squash is soft or the chickpeas are crispy (remove the chickpeas earlier if they are done before the squash).
6. While the squash and chickpeas are roasting, finely chop the onion and garlic.
7. Sauté the onion in a large pot over medium heat until translucent, then add the garlic and cook for another minute.
8. Add the roasted squash (including the skin) and blend the soup until smooth.
9. Add water until the soup reaches your desired consistency and heat through.
10. Serve with the roasted chickpeas on top. Optionally garnish with pumpkin seeds and black pepper.
