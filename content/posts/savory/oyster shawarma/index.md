I sat in my bed after eating this contemplating my life choices. How did I get here? Is being unemployed, making music and cooking oyster mushroom shawarma wraps at 3pm on a weekday the pinnacle of my existence? Maybe. Definitely tasted good though.

Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

### Ingredients for 2 servings

<small> You will have leftovers. I recommend just commiting to it, buying a kilo of mushrooms and making someone happy :) </small>

- [ ] 300 g oyster mushrooms, torn into strips
- [ ] 2–3 tbsp olive oil (plus more for frying)
- [ ] juice of 1/3 lemon
- [ ] 1 tsp soy sauce
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves, grated
- [ ] 1 tsp cumin
- [ ] 1 tsp coriander
- [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] 1/2 tsp turmeric
- [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
- [ ] 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- [ ] 1/4 tsp allspice or baharat
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt (adjust later)
- [ ] a pinch of chili
- [ ] flat Arabic bread (khubz)
- [ ] tahini or toum
- [ ] fresh parsley, chopped
- [ ] fresh mint, chopped
- [ ] 10 cherry tomatoes, sliced
- [ ] 1/2 red onion or pickled onions
- [ ] radishes, sliced thinly

### Steps

1. In a bowl combine olive oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, grated garlic, all the spices and salt. Mix until it becomes a thick, aromatic paste.
2. Tear the oyster mushrooms into long strips. Add them to the bowl and massage the marinade in. Let sit for 10 minutes.
3. Heat a wide pan with a bit of olive oil. Shake excess marinade off the mushrooms and add them **in one layer**. Press with a spatula and leave them alone until they brown. If they leak water, just crank the heat and let it evaporate. Add the rest of the marinade in at the last minute of cooking to glaze them.
4. Remove the mushrooms from the pain and heat your flatbread for a few seconds on each side. It has to be soft, otherwise it rips when you roll it.
5. Build the wrap
   - Spread tahini on the bottom third of the bread.  
   - Add parsley and mint.  
   - Layer tomatoes, onions, and radishes.
   - Add the mushrooms in a tight line across the middle.  
   - Drizzle a bit more sauce, optionally add some sumac if you're extra.
6. Fold up the bottom, tuck in the sides, then roll tightly upward. Press the 
seam.
7. Optionally grill the wrap in a panini press or grill pan for a few minutes to crisp up the outside.
