Very simple recipe today for some pasta that looks blander than it was. Sometimes, though, you just want to eat something that is not too complicated and that you can make in 30 minutes. This is one of those recipes. I grew the chard myself, so i was very happy to be able to use it in a recipe.

<div class="recipe">
Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 25 minutes

### Ingredients for 2 servings
- [ ] 250g dry pasta
- [ ] 3 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 1 teaspoon olive oil
- [ ] 10 cherry tomatoes
- [ ] greens to your liking (I used chard)

### Steps
1. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the garlic and cook until the garlic is translucent.
3. In a separate pot, cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package.
4. Add in the tomatoes and stir around. Then when they start to burst, add in a splash of the pasta water and your greens. Put aside when the greens are wilted.
5. When the pasta is done, add it to the pan and stir around.
