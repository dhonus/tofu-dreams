I've enjoyed this pasta salad largely thanks to the walnuts, which I haven't used with pasta before. When blended with the herbs, it tastes kind of like a pesto, I couldn't taste the walnuts that much. Perfect for some spare broccoli!

You can sub the oregano for cilantro or any other herb you like :)
