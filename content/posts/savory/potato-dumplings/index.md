This is a take on a Czech (I assume) recipe for potato dumplings with red cabbage. This took some thought because the filling is usually done with tofu and that's not something I find appealing in a dumpling.

Therefore, these use some protein powder with spices as filling. It is inspired by a restaurant I frequent, and it makes for a much better filling in my opinion.

In this recipe I cheated and used premade potato dumpling flour. You can make them yourself, they are actually quite simple to make. I thought it would take too much time.

Prep time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 60 minutes

### Ingredients for 2 servings
#### For the cabbage
- [ ] 1 head medium red cabbage, shredded
- [ ] 1 tbsp neutral oil
- [ ] 1 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1 red onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 small apple, finely grated
- [ ] 1 tbsp salt
- [ ] 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
#### For the dumplings
- [ ] 200g potato dumpling flour
- [ ] 200g water
#### For the filling
- [ ] 40g protein powder (I used a mix of pea and rice)
- [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika powder
- [ ] 1 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1 tsp onion powder
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tsp pepper
- [ ] 1 tsp neutral oil
#### Optionally add
- [ ] chili powder to taste

### Steps
1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium high heat and add your onion. Cook until translucent.
2. Add the cabbage and cook until it starts to wilt.
3. Add the garlic powder, salt and sugar. Pour in water so that the cabbage is submerged. Cook until the cabbage is soft. Then add the apple and cook for another 5 minutes.
4. In a bowl, mix the protein powder with the spices and oil. Add water until you get a thick paste.
5. In another bowl, mix the dumpling flour with the water until you get a dough.
6. Take a small piece of dough and flatten it. Add a small amount of filling and close the dough around it. Repeat until you run out of dough.
7. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the dumplings. Cook for 10 minutes. When the dumplings float, they are done.
8. Serve the dumplings with the cabbage, garnish with caramelized onions.
