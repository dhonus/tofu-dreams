I find myself in a bit of a curry rush lately, especially with the weather turning so chilly. As a natural reaction, of course, I have started cooking dense and filling dishes again. I also happen to like the way they look, albeit quite bare.

Here today is a *very* simple curry recipe even the most frostbitten of us can cook up in a heartbeat.

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 45 minutes

### Ingredients for 4 servings
- [ ] 1.5 cups uncooked red lentils, rinsed
- [ ] 1 large sweet potato, or 2 medium carrots
- [ ] 1/2 small zuccini, sliced into longer pieces about 1 cm thick
- [ ] 1 large red onion, chopped
- [ ] 4 cloves of garlic, grated or finely chopped
- [ ] small piece of ginger, grated or finely chopped
- [ ] 1 can tomatoes
- [ ] 1/2 coconut milk
- [ ] 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- [ ] 1 tablespoon curry spice
- [ ] salt and pepper and other herbs to taste
#### Optionally add
- [ ] a desired amount of leafy green vegetables (stay healthy!)
- [ ] juice of 1/2 lemon

### Steps
Rinse your red lentils and set aside.
1. Start by cutting up your vegetables into bite size pieces. Try using longer shapes as opposed to cubes.
2. Heat the coconut oil in a pan and saut√© the onion. After it turns translucent, add your garlic and ginger.
3. Add the lentils to the pan along with the tomatoes, sweet potato and zuccini.
4. Cover with enough water to have about 2cm of liquid above the surface and cover with a lid.
5. Bring down the heat and simmer over medium until the red lentils are quite soft.
6. Stir in your dry spices, optional ingredients and add the coconut milk.
7. Serve over rice.
