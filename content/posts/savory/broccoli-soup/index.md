I love broccoli, but sometimes it is left around for a bit longer than ideal and starts to break apart. It is impossible to use it then for anything unless you love random bits of broccoli everywhere.

Therefore, the best thing to do to it is blend it up! This recipe is for a simple soup made of broccoli and coconut milk.

<div class="recipe">
Prep time: 3 minutes

Cooking time: 10 minutes

### Ingredients for 5 servings
- [ ] 1 head of broccoli (1kg)
- [ ] 2 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
- [ ] small white onion, diced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons coconut milk
- [ ] 1 tablespoon of coconut or olive oil
- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

### Steps
No need to chop the onion and garlic too finely as we are will end by blending the soup. Do not overcook the broccoli, it is about the healthiest thing you can eat but not if you destroy all the nutrients.
1. Heat the oil in the pan and saut√© the onions until translucent together with the mustard seeds.
2. Add the garlic and get some color on both.
3. Add your broccoli in large chunks and pour over boiling water to stop the onions from burning. The broccoli should be covered by a bit of water. This will depends on how think you like your soup.
4. Cook until the broccoli has softened, but not completely soft.
5. Add salt, pepper and coconut milk (possible other spices (paprika, nutmeg)) and blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
