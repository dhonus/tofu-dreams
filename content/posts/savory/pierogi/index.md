I've been to Poland and they really do speak like that. But aside from the very funny name, these dumpligs are delicious indeed. With a smoky tofu filling, theyy aren't very hard to make either.

Prep time: 20 minutes + 30 minutes wait time

Cooking time: 15 minutes

### Ingredients for 10 pierogi
- [ ] 180 g all-purpose flour  
- [ ] 100 ml water (add according to dough texture)
- [ ] 2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
Filling
- [ ] 5 small potatoes
- [ ] 1 large carrot
- [ ] 1 block of marinated tofu (or smoked)
- [ ] 1 large red onion
- [ ] 3 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 1 tbsp smoked paprika powder
Topping
- [ ] 1 large white onion

### Steps
1. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, olive oil, and water and knead until you have a smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
2. Peel and chop the potatoes. Boil or microwave them until soft. Drain and mash them.
3. Peel and grate the carrot. Chop the onion and garlic finely. In a pan, heat some oil and sauté the onion and garlic until translucent. Add the grated carrot and mashed tofu, and cook for a few minutes. Add the smoked paprika and mix well. Combine this mixture with the mashed potatoes and season to taste.
4. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 2-3 mm thickness. Cut out circles using a glass or a cookie cutter.
5. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal. You can crimp the edges with a fork to look super special.
6. In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the pierogi in batches and cook for about 3-4 minutes or until they float to the surface.
7. In a separate pan, heat some oil and sauté the sliced white onion until golden brown.
8. Serve the pierogi topped with the sautéed onion.
