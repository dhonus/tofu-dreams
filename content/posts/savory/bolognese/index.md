Today I have for you a red lentil bolognese sauce. It is my own approximation of the traditional recipe. It is made from red lentils,
because they have more of a subtle flavor, and they cook really quickly. In this recipe I had used bucatini, but any long pasta
such as spaghettoni or spahgetti will do. You could top it with some vegan parmesan if you like.
