Tofu scramble is one of the simplest dishes to make using tofu.
Tofu is cheap has a lot of protein and is usually enriched with calcium.

I usually make mine with curry spice, but as any simple dish like this you can
use whatever you have on hand.

<div class="recipe">
Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 5 minutes

### Ingredients for 1 serving
- [ ] 1 block of tofu
- [ ] 1/2 onion (red is better)
- [ ] 1 clove of garlic
- [ ] 4 cherry tomatoes
- [ ] some spring onions
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of curry spice
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of coconut oil or neutral oil
- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

### Steps
You will need to mash up the tofu first. I usually squish it with my hands through 
the packaging. If yours comes in thick plastic you can mash it with a fork instead.
1. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and cook until the onion is translucent.
3. Add in the tomatoes and tofu and stir around.
4. Cook for a bit and then add your curry spice (we add it at the end because turmeric should not be cooked for long).
5. Pour in some water, or plant based milk and stir until combined and cooked through.
