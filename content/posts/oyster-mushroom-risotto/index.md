Risotto is an exercise in patience and knife skill. Today we have a simple oyster mushroom risotto with spinach that is 
creamy, savory and just so good!

Really make sure to use a good quality stock. Today I cheated and used a vegetable stock cube, but the stock makes or breaks the dish.
Also, the finer you chop the onion and garlic, the better. You want them to essentially melt into the rice. I take my time and chop them very finely.
