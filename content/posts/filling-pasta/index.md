Not sure how to describe this recipe. I usually make this because of how incredibly filling it is. It's also very
simple to make. Italians look away!

<div class="recipe">
Prep time: 5 minutes

Cooking time: 5 minutes

### Ingredients for 1 serving
- [ ] 1 block of tofu
- [ ] 1/2 onion (red is better)
- [ ] 1 clove of garlic
- [ ] 4 cherry tomatoes
- [ ] some spring onions
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of curry spice
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of coconut oil or neutral oil
- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

### Steps
You will need to mash up the tofu first. I usually squish it with my hands through 
the packaging. If yours comes in thick plastic you can mash it with a fork instead.
1. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and cook until the onion is translucent.
3. Add in the tomatoes and tofu and stir around.
4. Cook for a bit and then add your curry spice (we add it at the end because turmeric should not be cooked for long).
5. Pour in some water, or plant based milk and stir until combined and cooked through.
