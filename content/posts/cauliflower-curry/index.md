I make this recipe quite regularly. It's a great way to use up leftover cauliflower, and it's also very filling. I usually make a big batch and eat it for lunch for a few days.
You can experiment with different spices and vegetables. I've tried it with carrots in place of the sweet potato and it was also very good.
