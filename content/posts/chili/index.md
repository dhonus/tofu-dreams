Chili is something I take very seriously. There are quite a few recipes on the internet,
but naturally - mine is the best. It has been refined and perfected over 
many years, and I am very proud of it.

It is a great dish to make in bulk and freeze for later. It keeps in the fridge for about 5 days max.
