I don't really do holidays, but baking needlessly elaborate bread *is* something I can fuck with.
Vánočka is a type of Czech braided loaf with nuts and enough sugar to qualify as a substance problem. This one is heavily sugar reduced.

Prep time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Cooking time: 1 hour

### Ingredients for 1
- [ ] 500g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 3 tbsp finely ground nuts (e.g., almonds or hazelnuts)
- [ ] 50g chicory syrup (or other liquid sweetener)
- [ ] 1 packet dry yeast
- [ ] 100–110 ml almond milk (or other plant-based milk), sweetened
- [ ] 100 g vegan margarine
- [ ] lemon zest from 1/2 lemon
- [ ] handful of raisins
- [ ] sliced almonds (for topping)

### Steps
1. In a small bowl, combine the warm almond milk, chicory syrup, and yeast. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, ground nuts, and lemon zest.
3. Melt the margarine and let it cool slightly. Add it to the yeast mixture.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.
5. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.
6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
7. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into nine equal pieces.
8. Roll each piece into a long rope. Braid the ropes together to form a loaf.
9. Place the braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover it with a kitchen towel and let it rise for another 30 minutes.
10. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
11. Brush the top of the loaf with a little melted margarine mixed with milk and sprinkle with sliced almonds.
12. Bake the vánočka in the preheated oven for about 60 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
