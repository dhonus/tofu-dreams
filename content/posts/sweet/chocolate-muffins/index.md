Another muffin recipe? No complaining, these are delicious! Similar to the apple muffins, these are 
a bit more on the sweet side. This recipe has apple sauce in it, which makes it a bit more moist
and gives us an excuse not to put in as much sugar.

<div class="recipe">
Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

- [ ] 250g All Purpose Flour
- [ ] 50g Brown Sugar
- [ ] 4g Baking Powder
- [ ] Pinch of Salt
- [ ] 220ml plant based milk
- [ ] 1/2 cup of chocolate chips
- [ ] 125g apple sauce
- [ ] shot of espresso
- [ ] 50g melted coconut oil, or other neutral oil
- [ ] 40g cocoa powder

1. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder into a bowl.
2. Add the sugar and mix.
3. Add the milk, apple sauce, espresso and oil and mix until combined. The batter should be slightly runny. If it's too thick, add a bit more milk or applesauce.
4. Add the chocolate chips and mix.
5. Pour into muffin tins and bake at 180C for 20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.
