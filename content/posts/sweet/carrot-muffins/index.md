As the self-proclaimed muffin expert I am, I present to you a very easy to follow recipe for carrot muffins. They are very filling actually and delicious. Even though, to me, there's just something about carrot cake and muffins that feels odd, but it actually works pretty well.

I don't think coconut oil would work in this, but you're free to try. Especially if using refined coconut oil, it might be fine. I used sunflower oil and it worked well. Once again a conglomerate of various recipes I found online, reduced sugar and low-ish fat. But you can't make muffins healthy!

The batter will be slightly runny and that's completely OK. The muffins will rise and be fluffy. This can make about 7 muffins if you fill the cases to the top.
