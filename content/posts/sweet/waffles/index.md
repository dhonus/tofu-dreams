Who doesn't like a good waffle! This recipe is a great way to start your day. It's quick and easy to make, and it's a great way to use up leftover bananas.

Ideally the bananas should be overripe, the darker the better. The bananas act as a natural sweetener, so you don't need to add any sugar to the batter. The bananas also help to make the waffles nice and fluffy.
If your bananas aren't quite ripe enough, you can add a tablespoon of sugar.
If you happen to have no bananas (poor you), about 1/10 of the weight of flour in sugar can be used instead.
We also add a pinch of salt to balance out the flavor of the batter. 

This batter can be made without the use of any oil, but it is recommended and will depend on your waffle iron.
The milk may be substituted for water in dire need.
