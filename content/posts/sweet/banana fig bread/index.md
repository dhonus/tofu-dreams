This is an improved variation of my previou banana bread recipe. It uses only spelt flour and a higher proportion of whole wheat for, I think, better texture. The figs really make this bread so specia, the seeds add texture and the flavor of the figs just works incredible well here. Probably my favorite thing I have baked yet.

Prep time: 15 minutes

Baking time: 1 hour

### Ingredients for 1 bred
- [ ] 175g white spelt flour
- [ ] 150g whole wheat spelt flour
- [ ] 360g mashed ripe bananas (about 3 medium bananas)
- [ ] 120ml plant-based milk (I like almond in this)
- [ ] 50ml olive oil
- [ ] 4-5 figs, chopped
- [ ] 1/2 lime, juiced
- [ ] 5g baking powder (1 tsp)
- [ ] 4g baking soda (½ tsp)  
- [ ] 5g Ground Cinnamon (2 tsp)  
- [ ] pinch of salt  
#### Optionally add
- [ ] 1 banana for decoration, sliced lengthways
- [ ] 1 of the figs for decoration
- [ ] 50g chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans work well)
- [ ] 5ml vanilla extract

### Steps
1. Mash the bananas in a bowl until smooth.
2. Mix the banans with the remaining wet ingredients (milk, oil, lemon juice, vanilla).
3. Add the dry ingredients (flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon) to the wet mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
4. Fold in the figs and if using them, the chopped nuts. The batter should be thick but pourable. If it's too thick, add a little more plant-based milk.
5. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared tray and smooth the top.
7. Decorate with the sliced banana and fig.
8. Bake for 45m-1h, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
