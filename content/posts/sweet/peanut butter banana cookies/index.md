I mean if you like bananas and peanut butter, this is the cookie for you really. And the fact that they have no added sugar and you still haven't made them is just not acceptable :)

<div class="recipe" id="recipe">
Prep time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: 15 minutes

### Ingredients
- [ ] 2 Bananas + 1 for topping (very ripe)
- [ ] 100 g peanut butter
- [ ] 20 g chicory syrup
- [ ] 180 g oat flour
- [ ] 60 g chocolate chips
- [ ] 1 tsp cinnamon
- [ ] 1 tsp baking powder

### Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 180˚C and line your baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, mash up the 2 bananas, add the peanut butter and chicory syrup and mix it well until you have a brownish paste.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and cinnamon.
4. Add the wet to the dry gradually, also add in the chocolate chips. Combine until you have a big ball of cookie dough.
5. Take an icecream scooper (or if you're built different just use your hands) and make golf ball sized balls onto your tray and flatten them a bit because they won´t really expand much.
6. Add a round slice of banana onto each cookie and push it in a bit.
7. Put the cookies in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until they're a bit golden on the top.
