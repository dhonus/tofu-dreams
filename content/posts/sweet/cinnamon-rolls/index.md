As it stands I try to publish recipes that I have come up with, or at least significantly altered. This time, however, a recipe is so
good I just had to share it! It is a Tasty recipe - [https://tasty.co/recipe...](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-ever-vegan-cinnamon-rolls), with slight measurements tweaks.

We have made it on Valentine's Day according to the recipe, however a sugar reduction has not suited this recipe well. I would recommend using the full amount of sugar.
I have eaten these for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and they are just so good ðŸ˜­... I hope you enjoy them as much as we did!

Prep time: 45 minutes

Cooking time: 30 minutes

**Ingredients for 12 rolls**
- [ ] 700g All Purpose Flour
- [ ] 115g vegan butter
- [ ] 50g sugar (20g white sugar, 30g brown sugar)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 480ml plant based milk
- [ ] 1 packet dry yeast

**For the filling**
- [ ] 175g vegan butter
- [ ] 150g brown granulated sugar
- [ ] 3 tablespoons cinnamon

1. In a large bowl, mix the melted butter, sugar and milk. Add the yeast and mix.
2. Add the flour and mix until a dough forms. Add in the salt. 
3. Cover the bowl with a towel and let it rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
4. After the dough has rested add the remaining 100g of flour and knead the dough for a minute or two, until it forms a smooth ball.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a rectangle. Spread the butter over the dough, then sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon over the butter.
6. Roll the dough up tightly, starting from the long side. Cut the dough into 12 or so equal pieces.
7. Place the rolls in a lined baking dish, cover with a towel and let them rise for 15 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
9. Bake the rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
10. Frosting is overrated. :)
