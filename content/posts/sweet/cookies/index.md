Continuing on my little sweet baking spree, I could never get cookies to taste nice until my girlfriend found a recipe that works. With the usual sugar reduction and switch to plant-based milk, these cookies are oh so good!

It is important not to overbake them as they will become very dry and hard (I sadly know this from experience, my cookies used to be real tooth breakers).
