What's this site about? Well food of course! I love to cook and bake, and I love to share my recipes with others.

The recipes are **all vegan**, and most of them I try to make with local ingredients. I usually make them **as healthy as possible**, but I also like to make some treats every now and then.
I aim to keep the description to the point and short. Also, I tend to mention some basic rules of the dish and which ingredients are optional.

The problem with most cooking sites is that they **tend to be very cluttered** and filled with ads. Everything takes ages to load and 
every recipe has to have a mountain of text about the author and their life story. I don't want to read that, I just want to see the recipe!

Therefore, I made this site. It's simple, it's fast, and it's easy to use. I hope you find a recipe you like!
