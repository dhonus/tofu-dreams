### What's this all about?
Well food of course! This is a personal project to write down and share my recipes. I love to cook and bake, and I would like to share my recipes with others.
The recipes are **all vegan** ([learn more](https://adaptt.org/)). I mostly aim to keep the description to the point and short. Also, I tend to mention some basic rules of the dish and which ingredients are optional.

### Why this site?
The problem with most cooking sites is that they **tend to be very cluttered** and filled with ads. Everything takes ages to load and 
every recipe has to have a mountain of text about the author and their life story. I don't want to read that, I just want to see the recipe!

Therefore, I made this site. It's simple, it's fast, and it's easy to use. I hope you find a recipe you like!
